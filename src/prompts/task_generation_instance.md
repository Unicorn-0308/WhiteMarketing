## User's Description

## General Guidelines
**Overarching Principle for Creative Requests:**
*   **EVERY creative request MUST be logged as a task in Asana.**

**I. When & How to Initiate Task Creation (Pre-Asana Steps):**

1.  **Plan with Client (Step 1 - Creatives Request):**
    *   Identify client needs (marketing calendar, promotions).
    *   Educate client on asset delivery timelines (min. 1 day before designer starts).
    *   Validate a micro-planning timeline.
2.  **Gather & Upload Assets (Step 2 - Creatives Request & Ads Scripts Best Practices):**
    *   Receive client assets ASAP.
    *   Upload to the relevant Google Drive folder (e.g., "gdrive / [xxx. Client Name] / Creative Material").
    *   If a script is needed:
        *   Use **Image/Video Ad Script Templates** (Google Docs).
        *   Follow naming format: `[INT] or [EXT] “date:DDMMYYYY” - “Client’s name” “Main theme of script” “Type of ad(Image or video)” script`.
        *   Save scripts in the client's "Ads Scripts Repository" folder.
        *   The script/brief itself should contain detailed visual guidelines, text, timing, format, inspiration, logo/font requirements, and links to specific stock assets if pre-selected (AdobeStock, MotionArray, Envato Elements – tag Sue for retrieval from Envato/MotionArray or if AdobeStock images are needed).
3.  **Daily Review (Daily Project Management):**
    *   At the start of each day, review Asana Inbox, Emails, and Slack for any new requests that need to be turned into Asana tasks.

**II. Asana Task Creation – The Core Process:**

1.  **Who Assigns & Where:**
    *   **ALL Asana design tasks are assigned to Sue.** She then redirects to the correct designer.
    *   Tasks are created in the **"Design" board** in Asana.
    *   You can create the task (block the designer's calendar) even before receiving all assets if the slot is confirmed.
    *   General tasks (non-client or internal marketing) go into "White Marketing Tasks" or team members' personal project boards.
2.  **Task Creation - General Best Practices (How We Use Asana):**
    *   **Assignee:** Sue (for design tasks).
    *   **Projects:** Add to the relevant project (e.g., "Design" board, specific client board).
    *   **Tags:** **Always add client tags.**
    *   **Dependencies:** Add if the task relies on another.
3.  **Task Content – What to Include (Crucial Checklist from "Creatives Request" & "Ads Scripts Best Practices"):**
    *   **Title:** Clear and descriptive.
    *   **Description (for others, use structure - How We Use Asana):**
        *   **GOAL:** What you want to achieve.
        *   **METHOD USED:** Bullet points with clear, actionable steps.
        *   **FINAL OUTPUT:** What the final result should be.
    *   **Deadline:** Clearly specified.
    *   **Priority:** **Always include Low / Medium / High.**
        *   **Low:** No impact if done a week later.
        *   **Medium:** Can be done ~1-3 days after due date.
        *   **High:** Urgent, needs completion by deadline. (For <1 week deadlines, ask Sue's confirmation in comments).
    *   **Attachments/Links (Mandatory for Design Tasks):**
        *   **Script/Brief:** Link to the filled-out Google Doc script/brief template (if applicable).
        *   **Client Creative Assets:** Link to the Google Drive folder with all assets.
        *   **Client Context and Guidelines:** Link to brand guidelines, PPC strategy, etc.
        *   **Desired Output:** Link to any specific output requirements if not in script.
        *   **Examples:** If available, share former Ads/Videos or competitor examples.
        *   **Specifications:** Video/Image length, sizes, and target platforms.
4.  **Timing & Lead Time for Design Tasks:**
    *   **Asset Delivery:** Material should be provided to the designer **at least 1 day before** they start (ideally 3-4 days). Notify Sue ASAP if there are delays.
    *   **Task Assignment Lead Time (General):** Assign tasks at least 2 days in advance, except for emergencies.
    *   **Workload Consideration:** 1 Video ≈ 1 workday; 1 Banner Set ≈ 1 workday. Allow ~3 days for design creation (Ads Scripts Best Practices).
5.  **Subtask Creation (for Scripts - "Creatives Request"):**
    *   If the asset requires a script, create a **subtask within the main design task.**
    *   **Assign the subtask to the Copywriter.**
    *   **Subtask Content:** Should specify requirements for visual background guidelines, text, time, and contextual guidelines.
    *   **Subtask Deadline:** Set ~3 days **EARLIER** than the main task's deadline (to allow your review).
    *   **Requester's Responsibility:** **FUNDAMENTAL STEP** - Double-check the script and request corrections/adaptations from the copywriter.
    *   Mark the copywriter's subtask as completed once the script is approved.
    *   The designer will only start working on the main task once the script subtask is marked as done.
6.  **Emergency Requests (when all designers are booked):**
    *   Create the emergency request task in Asana.
    *   Inform Sue & the marketing manager via Slack.
    *   Options (to be discussed based on client value/priority):
        *   An existing task is postponed, and Sue works on the emergency.
        *   Sue delegates the emergency task to another designer.

In essence, task creation is a structured process starting with client planning, asset gathering, and script/brief preparation, culminating in a detailed Asana task assigned to Sue (for design) with all necessary information, links, priority, and deadlines clearly defined. Subtasks are used for scriptwriting to ensure clear handoffs.
