## General Guidelines
This is General Guidelines to build Weekly or Monthly Review.
This outlines two key client review processes: a Weekly Review and a Monthly Review, designed to enhance project coordination, client communication, and strategic progress.

**Weekly Review Process (approx. 1 hour or less):**

*   **Purpose:** Essential for top-notch project coordination, monitoring, progress, and client communication. Aims to deliver actionable insights, build client trust, and guide strategic decisions efficiently. The preparation itself forms an action plan for the upcoming week.
*   **Document Structure:**
    1.  **Highlight Section:** An engaging main point to capture attention and spark discussion.
    2.  **General KPI Section:** Goes beyond presenting KPIs to *analyze* changes (1-2 key findings weekly), suggest solutions/tests, and tailor content with different focuses each week.
    3.  **Next Steps:** Mostly planned before the call, with additions during the meeting.
    4.  **Last Week's Focus:** A backlog for quick review or deeper dives.
    5.  **Post-Call Project Management:** 15 minutes allocated after calls to convert next steps into Asana tasks with details.
*   **Process:**
    *   Consultant completes the client's review card (a copy of the last update, reworked) *before* the weekly client meeting.
    *   Responsibilities are documented if multiple team members are involved.
    *   Project Lead reviews and adds "Verified" status in Slite by week's end, but **approval is NOT required before sending to the client.**
*   **Sharing with Client:**
    *   Options (per Client Updated PM Matrix):
        *   **PDF:** Simplest option.
        *   **Slite Link to Collection:** Share the *entire* "Weekly Reviews" collection with client emails as "Guests" (Reader access only). Name the collection with "[EXT]".
    *   **Very Important Security Notes:**
        *   Share only as "Reader," not inviting to the entire workspace.
        *   Avoid public links for large spending clients due to data breach risks (requires mentor approval).
        *   When sharing via individual emails, clients *can* see comments (even resolved ones). Public links hide resolved comments.
*   **Recommendation:** Fill the Slite card with insights as they arise.

**Monthly Review Process (30-45 mins max):**

*   **Purpose:** Fosters transparency, accountability, client satisfaction, and strengthens relationships by keeping clients informed on medium-term goals.
*   **Key Difference from Weekly:** It **should not** repeat weekly operational details. Instead, it focuses on:
    *   Longer KPI timeframes (Month-over-Month).
    *   Less detailed, more strategic action points.
    *   Non-tactical considerations (e.g., process improvements, communication).
*   **Relationship to Weekly:** The monthly review "feeds" the weekly updates, ensuring weekly work aligns with set mid-term goals.
*   **Process:**
    *   Consultant fills internally by the **3rd of each month**.
    *   Project Lead reviews and provides feedback.
    *   Shared with clients (link) by the **5th of the month** *after* Project Lead approval.
    *   Additional formats (slides/docs) can be linked to Slite.
